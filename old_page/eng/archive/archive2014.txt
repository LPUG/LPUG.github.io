========================================
Leipzig Python User Group - Archive 2014
========================================


Ninety First Meeting, Tuesday January 14, 2014
----------------------------------------------

We prepared our both at Chemnitzer Linux Tage.
We created some small Python programs on a Raspberry Pi, which we
can present in Chemnitz.

The next meeting will be on February 11, 2014.


Ninety Second Meeting, Tuesday February 11, 2014
------------------------------------------------

We continued our booth preparation for Chemnitz. Unfortunately, the
Raspberry Pi had some problems with the WiFi stick and crashed several times.

The next meeting will be on March 11, 2014.

Ninety Third Meeting, Tuesday March 11,  2014
------------------------------------------------

This time our topic was "Virtual Environments with conda and pip ".
Virtual environment simplify installation and using of different Python
versions as well as working with different versions of a library.
In addition to the well known pip_, conda_ offers similar capabilities.
The advantage of conda is its ability to install compiled Python extensions,
whereas pip typically installs the source distribution. Following an extend
discussion we also looked at  wheels_. Indeed, the installation of Python
package has become much simpler.


.. _pip: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip
.. _conda: http://conda.pydata.org/docs/
.. _wheels: http://pythonwheels.com/

The next meeting will be on April 8, 2014.

Ninety Fourth Meeting, Tuesday April 8,  2014
------------------------------------------------

We ha a presentation:

| 
| Manuel Jacob
| **CFFI - Python mit C verbinden**    
| 

CFFI_ offer a solution for writing Python bindings for C libraries.

Manuel introduced CFFI and its usage. Code samples of existing bindings
showed how CFFI works.
Together we wrote a binding for a C library.

The next meeting will be on May 13, 2014.

Ninety Fifth Meeting, Tuesday May 13,  2014
------------------------------------------------

We had another talk:

| 
| Sven Richter
| **Twisted - Ereignis-orientierte Netzwerkprogrammierung**    
| 


Twisted is an event-driven networking Python framework for easy
programming of network server and client applications.

Sven quickly introduced how Twisted works. He put more emphasis on the
class Deferred. We had very lively discussion about advantage and
disadvantages of Twisted.

The next meeting will be on June 10, 2014.


Ninety Sixth Meeting, Tuesday June 10,  2014
------------------------------------------------

This meeting featured a demonstration on how to write decorators:


| 
| Mike MÃ¼ller
| **Decorators - An Elegant Way to Extend Functions with Cross-Cutting Functionality**    
| 

Decorators allow to add functionality to a function without modifying
the function body. This especially interesting for cross-cutting problems such
as logging or run time measurements. 

The implementation as a function that returns a function needs
some time to get used to. The demonstration with live coding
showed that is not that difficult as long as the programmer consequently
applies a few simple principles. 

Having our meeting outside, we enjoyed the nice weather. The BBQ supplied
tasty energy sources for our involved topic.

Due to the soccer world championship and the EuroPython conference, we have a summer break.
The next meeting will be on September 9, 2014.

Ninety Seventh Meeting, Tuesday September 9, 2014
-------------------------------------------------

This very well attended meeting started with a highly interesting talk:

| Stefan Schwarzer
| **Single Source for Python 2 and 3**    
| 

It is possible to use the same source code for Python 2 und 3 programs.
This presentation showed how to do this with a stress on best practices
based on real-world experience.

The
`slides <http://sschwarzer.com/download/python_2_3_europython2014.pdf>`_
provide lots of tips how to writer modern Python code for Python 2 and 3.

We also had a short talk about `Tryton <http://www.tryton.org>`_
and the upcoming `Tryton Unconference <http://tul2014.tryton.org>`_ in Leipzig
turning into a discussion about open source licensing.

The next meeting will be on Oktober 14, 2014.

Ninety Eighty Meeting, Tuesday October, 2014
--------------------------------------------

We had a very interesting, short presentation:

| Arnold Krille
| **Hacking bleach: turn the HTML Sanitizer from a Whitelist into Blacklist**    
| 

Python is very flexible. The presentation provides a nice example how to
integrate new, originally not planned features into a Python tool.
It only takes a little though to change the behavior without modifying
the library code.

Furthermore, we had short reports from EuroPython 2014 in Berlin, Germany
and EuroSciPy 2014 in Cambridge, UK. These are two rather different but very
interesting conferences. 

Weiterhin hatten wir Kurzberichte von der EuroPython 2014 in Berlin und der
EuroSciPy 2014 in Cambridge. Das sind zwei recht unterschiedliche, aber sehr
interessante Konferenzen.
  
The next meeting will be on November 11, 2014.

Ninety Ninth Meeting, Tuesday November 11, 2014
-----------------------------------------------

Again, the meeting was well attended and we use the available room to
the last inch.

We had a terrific presentation:  

| Andreas Bunkahle
| **Kivy and Python**
|

Kivy is a NUI (Natural User Interface) framework that works on many platforms
such as Windows, OSX, Android, IOS und Linux.
It provides everything that one needs to write a modern application.
This includes multitouch, audio and video, camera input, graphics
as well as Internet connection. 
PyInstaller helps to create standalone commercial and non commercial applications.
The talk uses a word learning application as an example to showcase how to
use Kivy with Python. 

Links for this topic:

| The example word learning application VocMaster: http://www.abunkahle.de
| An Introduction to Kivy for Mobile Programming (German): http://pythonmobile.blogspot.de/
| The Kivy Website: http://www.kivy.org
| OyCon videos about Kivy: http://pyvideo.org/search?models=videos.video&q=kivy

The next meeting will be on December 12, 2014.


One Hundredth Meeting, Tuesday December 12, 2014
------------------------------------------------

We celebrated our one hundredth Meeting right in time for the holidays.
We met at a restaurant.
We had short review of the user group history. We started in February 2006
with a rather small group and needed a few meetings to grow the number of
attendees. Based on our one-meeting-a-month rhythm, we would have had a
maximum of 107 meetings. Five meetings were replaced by workshops, PyCon DE
and EuroPython conference. We were involved in their organization.
We chose to have a summer break instead of two meetings.

We had engaging chats and a somewhat different atmosphere that during the
other meetings that typically start off with a presentation. Everybody
like it and our group was the last to leave the well-filled restaurant.   

The next meeting will be on January 13, 2015.
