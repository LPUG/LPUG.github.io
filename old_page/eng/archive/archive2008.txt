Twenty Second Meeting, Tuesday January 8, 2008
---------------------------------------------------------
 
Again, a few new people showed up. Mike Mueller gave a presentation
about the use of Python for a coupled simulation model.
The following look at the model's source code triggered an
interesting discussion about coding styles. The Python newbees were
introduced to PEP8_. But also the ones that use Python for longer
could learn something new.

The next meeting will be on February 12th, 2008.

Maik Derstappen will give a persentation about Plone.

Thirtieth  Meeting, Tuesday September 9, 2008
-------------------------------------------------

We improved a solution for programming competition for the
German Linux-Magazin.

The next meeting will be on Tuesday, October 14, 2008. 


Thirty First  Meeting, Tuesday October 14, 2008
-------------------------------------------------

The question if doctest works properly with unicode was the central point
of our discussion. After an extensive search, we found out that
doc strings are just ordinary Python strings. Therefore, contained
back slashes have to be escaped or the whole doc string has to be a raw
string.  Group intelligence at work.


The next meeting will be on Tuesday, November 11, 2008. 


Thirty Second  Meeting, Tuesday November 11, 2008
-------------------------------------------------

The `Programming competition of German LINUX Magazin`_ provided lots
to talked about. Python was the most frequent language among the
sent in solutions. Number of lines and run times favorably compare
with the solutions in other languages. The comparison with languages
such as Perl, Ocaml, Haskell or ruby was really interesting.
 

The next meeting will be on Tuesday, December 11, 2008.
The topic is "Generators in Python as unix-like pipelines".

Thirty Third  Meeting, Tuesday December 9, 2008
-------------------------------------------------

Our topic was "Generators in Python as unix-like pipelines". Chaining several
generators yields a special programming style. At some point we had the
impression to use a language different from Python. Used in the right way,
generators can have advantages especially for large amounts of data.
 

The next meeting will be on Tuesday, January 13, 2009.
