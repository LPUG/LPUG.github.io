Forty Sixth Meeting, Tuesday January 12, 2010
---------------------------------------------

|markus| introduced the modules xml.sax_ and
xml.sax.handler_. They are useful for fast processing of large amounts
of XML data.
It was an interesting talk about the method of event-oriented parsing
with SAX. We enjoyed an exhaustive explanation of the sample program.


The next meeting will be February 9, 2010.
Stefan Schwarzer will rehearse his presentation for the
`Chemnitzer Linux Tage`_ titled "Robustere Python-Programme"
(More Robust Python Programs).

There was some constructive feedback.
Furthermore, we talked about planned our booth at the Linux-Fest
`Chemnitzer Linux Tage`_ .

The next meeting will be March 9, 2010.
|Mike| will talk about `PyCon 2010`_.

Forty Eighth Meeting, Tuesday March 9, 2010
----------------------------------------------

|Mike| summarized what happened at `PyCon 2010`_.
The focus was on topics such as different Python implementations such as
CPython, Jython, IronPython, and PyPy, web development, migration
to Python 3.x, and testing.

The next meeting will be April 13, 2010.
We will evaluate our booth at the Linux Fest `Chemnitzer Linux Tage`_
and plan improvements for next year.

Forty Ninth Meeting, Tuesday April 13, 2010
----------------------------------------------

Again, there were two new participants. They came from
around Jena, a city about one hour away.
We intensively discussed several topics.
We talked about how to make posters and other materials to
present our user group at trade fairs and conferences.
We did some early stage planning for a bar camp in Leipzig.
This was inspired by the `bar camp by the user group in cologne`_.
We should get a decent number of people together. Just counting
the regular user group goers in Leipzig and Berlin and
some people we know would likely come from cities within
2-hour-traveling distance makes it worthwhile.


The next meeting will be May 11, 2010.
Julian Moritz will give a talk about CouchDB_.

Fiftieth Meeting, Tuesday May 11, 2010
--------------------------------------

Julian Moritz gave an interesting talk about CouchDB_.
Important concept when working with CouchDB are JSON, HTTP,
no schema and parallelism as well as using the map-reduce
approach for queries. He had to answer many questions of course
focusing on the use of CouchDB with Python. This time 13 people
showed up. Again we had three newcomers.

The next meeting will be June 1, 2010.
Please not. This one week earlier than our regular second Tuesday
of the month.

Fifty First Meeting, Tuesday June 1, 2010
-----------------------------------------

Christina Theune  of gocept_ gave a very interesting talk about the
ZODB_. The co-developer of ZODB povided plenty of background information
besides demos about the usage. It became very clear that the ZODB is a
real object database not just a "relational database with an object
curtain".


The next meeting will be July 13, 2010.

Fifty Second Meeting, Tuesday July 13,2010
------------------------------------------

|mike| talked about the EuroSciPy_ conference in Paris.
The number of attendees has more than tripled since the last
conference 2009 in Leipzig, Germany.
This shows the increasing interest in Python for
scientific an technical purposes.

There were two days filled with tutorials for beginners as well
as advanced users about the usage of NumPy, Scipy, Matplotlib,
Mayavi  or version control, testing and extensions in other languages.
The following two days were packed with interesting talks
about Python in diverse fields such as mathematics, physics and
biology as well as GIS and software tools for the scientific work flow.

The next meeting will be on August 10, 2010.

Fifty Third Meeting, Tuesday August 10, 2010
--------------------------------------------

Stefan Schwarzer gave a short report about EuroPython_ and
|mike| summarized OSCON_.
|markus| gave a talk about `distribute, pip and virtualenv`_.
We had a lively discussion about this topic that was
interesting for everybody.


The next meeting will be on September 21, 2010.
This is one week later than the usual second Tuesday of the month
because of an overlap with the DZUG-conference_ in Dresden.

Fifty Forth Meeting, Tuesday September 21, 2010
-----------------------------------------------

We met one week later than the usual second Tuesday of the month
because of an overlap with the DZUG-conference_ in Dresden.

Stefan Schwarzer talked about the Unified Modeling Language (UML).
The `interesting presentation`_ ignited a fruitful discussion that
covered even more aspects of UML.
A `class diagram`_ with VioletUML demonstrates the how the UML can be applied.

In addition, we talked about PyConDe, the German Python conference, and
the meeting about this topic at the DZUG-conference.

The next meeting will be on Oktober 12, 2010.
|markus| will talk about "Celery - Eine asynchrone Task
Queue (nicht nur) |fuer| Django".

Fifty Fifth Meeting, Tuesday October 12, 2010
-----------------------------------------------

|markus| gave the talk "Celery - Eine asynchrone Task
Queue (nicht nur) für Django". The slides are available as PDF_ 
or at scribd_. He nicely explained the possibilities for parallel
and cron tasks of Celery. A spam filter in Django for blog entries
served as an example. The potentially time consuming filtering
is asynchronously handed over to an external service. The user
interface of the web application stays reactive during this time.  

Then we talked about PyConDe 2011. We concluded that Leipzig
would be a good location for it. We are going to submit an
application.

The next meeting will be on November 9, 2010.
We will have a sprint to improve the content and setup of the python.de
web site.

Fifty Sixth Meeting, Tuesday November 9, 2010
---------------------------------------------

We had a sprint to improve the python.de website with information about
Python in German speaking countries. We use the Python-based CMS Plone.
Everybody is invited to contribute. The portal can be reached at its temporary
location http://python.inqbus.de  and will evntually move to python.de.
You can register yourself to get write access. If you think you need more
user rights please e-mail Maik Derstappen (maik [_DOT_] derstappen [_AT_]
derstappen-it [_DOT_] de).

The next meeting will be on December 14, 2010.


Fifty Seventh Meeting, Tuesday December 14, 2010
------------------------------------------------

We prepared our booth presentation at Chemnitzer Linuxtage 2011.
We will improve our poster. Furthermore, we will put all Python-related
booths (Python, Django, Zope) together to utilize synergy effects.

Another topic was a case study comparing a C++ with a Python program both
solving the same problem. The Python program needs only one third of the lines
and is much easier to read an understand.
 
The next meeting will be on January 11, 2011.
