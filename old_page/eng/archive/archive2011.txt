Leipzig Python User Group - Archive 2011
========================================

Fifty Eighth Meeting, Tuesday January 11, 2011
-----------------------------------------------

We continued to work on our presentation at Chemnitzer Linuxtage 2011.
We got nice material from pyCologne, the user group n Cologne that we can use.

We looked at co-routines and concurrent programming. Python's generators with
their ability to take messages from outside are built into the language and
help programming in this style.


The next meeting will be on February 15, 2011.

**Note**: This will be one week later than or regular second Tuesday of the
month. 


Fifty Nineth Meeting, Tuesday February 15, 2011
-----------------------------------------------

We looked at `OpenCV for Python`_ , a very interesting library for tracking
movements. We had a variety of Python topics to talk about.

month.


Sixtieth Meeting, Tuesday March 15, 2011
----------------------------------------

For some time we, the Leipzig Python User Group, has contacts with Leipzig Rails community.
This meeting was a joint event at Topics Maps Lab in Johannisgasse, Leipzig.
We wanted to intensify the exchange between both groups and to get to know new
technologies and  solutions.


The next meeting will be on April 19, 2011.

Sixty First Meeting, Tuesday April 19, 2011
-------------------------------------------

This time folks form Leipzig Ruby User Group Leipzig on Rails`_ came to our meeting
at the traditional location Python Academy. Christoph Petschnig introduced Rails 3.
We had intensive discussion  about similarities nd difference between  Ruby and Python
as well as between Rails and Django. All in all a very successful event.

The next meeting will be on May 10, 2011.

Sixty Second Meeting, Tuesday May 10, 2011
------------------------------------------

We talked about several "smaller" topics such as some Python packages,
conferences and a bunch of other things.

The next meeting will be on June 14, 2011.



Sixty Third Meeting, Tuesday June 14, 2011
------------------------------------------

Andreas Bunkahle talked about OpenCV and Python:

OpenCV is a very powerful and fast image processing and computer vision library.
The combination of OpenCV 2.1 and Python 2.6 is stable and  works reliably.
Features include face and pattern recognition, web cam control, and morphing
among many others.

The next meeting will be on July 12, 2011.


Sixty Fourth Meeting, Tuesday July 12, 2011
-------------------------------------------

We discussed about Python IDEs, their functionality as well as their
advantages and disadvantages. Other topics included Cython and NumPy.
The forthcoming PyCon DE was another theme during our meeting.

The next meeting will be on August 9, 2011.


Sixty Fifth Meeting, Tuesday August 9, 2011
-------------------------------------------

|mike| demonstrated the use of ctypes_ with an example.
Because ctypes is part of the standard library und pretty easy to use, it is
really good way to access DLLs. If you work with Python 3 you need to take
care to handle strings, which are unicode by default. Don't forget to encode
and decode them before and after exchange with the DLL if the strings in the
DLL are ASCII, which is rather common.

The next meeting will be on September 27, 2011.

Sixty Sixth Meeting, Tuesday September 27, 2011
-----------------------------------------------

|mike| talked about HDF5 and how to use it from Python. This sparked a
lively discussion about details and border cases for HDF5 usage from everybody
learned something new.  

The next meeting will be on November 8, 2011.
We will evaluate `PyCon DE 2011 <http://de.pycon.org/2011>`_.
Many members of our user group were deeply involved in the organization of this
first German PyCon.

Sixty Seventh Meeting, Tuesday November 8, 2011
-----------------------------------------------

We evaluated `PyCon DE 2011 <http://de.pycon.org/2011>`_.
Many members of our user group were deeply involved in the organization of this
first German PyCon. 

The conference was a great success. About 50% of the participants gave feedback,
which was overwhelmingly positive. The organization was super. The presentations
and tutorials were really good. We received a few suggest what to improve that
should be considered next year. Though, some of the suggestions of opposite
goals.

We decided to apply for PyCon DE 2012. To have a conference at the same place
twice seems to work well (see PyCon US, EuroPython and EuroSciPy). The PyCon DE
2011 makes a good reference in any case. 

The next meeting will be on December 13, 2011.


Sixty Eighth Meeting, Tuesday December 13, 2011
-----------------------------------------------

|markus| introduced the Python client `dedun`_ that offers access to the
API for the information server of the City of Leipzig. Topics included design
and development of the software as well as the testing with py.test_.

The presentation_ was utmost interesting and lead to a very productive
discussion. The talk clearly presented the different phases of development and
the according changes in the approach. 
 
The next meeting will be on January 10, 2012.
