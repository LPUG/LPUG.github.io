Fortieth Meeting, Tuesday July 14, 2009
-------------------------------------------------

Stefan Schwarzer talked about `EuroPython 2009`_.
This was the biggest EuroPython so far: 450 attendees,
There were 15 tutorials (4 parallel at a time) and 80 presentations
(6 parallel at a time). Obviously, the organizers did not
expect that many people since the venue was really crowed.

There were a bunch of interesting keynotes. 
The focus of the scheduled presentations was mainly on web development
Python implementations, testing, and community.
There was open space besides the scheduled talks (called unconference).
The next EuroPython will be again in Birmingham. The EuroPython 2011
might be in Germany.

As always, we had interesting discussions.
This time we talked mainly about Python as replacement or addition
to shell scripts.


The next meeting will be on Tuesday, August 11, 2009.

Forty Third Meeting, Tuesday Oktober 13, 2009
-----------------------------------------------

We had a few new people showing up. Since most of them hadn't done a lot
with Python a lively discussion over the advantages of Python developed.
Python basics were explained with interactive examples.


The next meeting will be on Tuesday,  November 10, 2009.
There will be reports from the RuPy conference.


Forty Forth Meeting, Tuesday November 10, 2009
----------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, none of the RuPy attendees made to the meeting
Therefore, we didn't have their reports.
We made do with the slides of presentations from RuPy we found
online. After all, we learned some interesting things about
PyPy.

The next meeting will be December 1. This one week earlier
than the usual second Tuesday of the month. Christmas shows
its presence.

Forty Fifth Meeting, Tuesday December 1, 2009
---------------------------------------------

This time we got the reports from the RuPy attendees
originally scheduled for last meeting.
It seems to have been a really interesting
conference. Python and Ruby have enough in common to make
such a conference work.
 
The next meeting will be January 12, 2010.
Markus |markus| will introduce the modules xml.sax_ and
xml.sax.handler_. They are useful for fast processing of large amounts
of XML data.
