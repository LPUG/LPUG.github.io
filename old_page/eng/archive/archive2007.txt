Leipzig Python User Group - Archive 2007
========================================
 
Eleventh Meeting, Tuesday January 9, 2007
---------------------------------------------------------
 
We met on January 9 at 8:00 pm at the training center of Python Academy in Leipzig, Germany.
Stefan Schwarzer gave his presentation about Trac_. He used the trac-site of ftputil_
that was created and is maintained by him. 
The demonstration at a life site was impressive. The discussion about
the presentation was followed by an exchange of ideas about Python and its
relation to other programming languages.  This covered both Lisp and FORTRAN and then some.

The next meeting will be on February 13, 2007. The topic will be announced soon.


Twelfth Meeting, February 13, 2007
---------------------------------------------------------

We met on February 13 at 8:00 pm at the training center of Python Academy in Leipzig, Germany.
We talked about Pyrex_ and its application to performance critical applications.
We achieved run time improvements with Pyrex that exceed the factor of ten for
codes that involve lots of numerical computations.

The next meeting will be on March 13, 2007. The topic will be Python for scientific applications.

Thirteens Meeting, March 13, 2007
---------------------------------------------------------

We met on March 13 at 8:00 pm at the training center of Python Academy in Leipzig, Germany.
This time our main topic was Python for scientific applications.
The discussion focused on Python's abilities for data input.
We looked at YAML_ and the implementation of the serialization formats in Python
PyYAML_.


The next meeting will be on April 10, 2007.

Fourteens Meeting, April 10, 2007
---------------------------------------------------------

We could welcome two new people. We had interesting discussions.
Our conlusion: Django_ is better than PHP.

Stefan Schwarzer gave his presentation `Speed up your Python code`_ again,
because we asked him to do so.


The next meeting will be on May 8, 2007.


Fifteens Meeting, May 5, 2007
------------------------------

Philippe Morath gave a very interesting talk about programming of mobile phones
with Python on the S60 platform. Slides are available in German ( 
`Mobiltelefonprogrammierung mit Python`_).
First he gave an overview of mobile phones and the S60 platform as well as
possibilties of programming mobile phones.
He explained installation and use of Python S60 on a mobile phone. Next, he
talked about using Python S60 in the emualtor.
Finally, he showed simple examples for applications and gave an overview of
the PyS60 API.

There was a stimulative discussion about possibilties of application. Localization
of mobile phones war one of the main discussion topics.

Again, we could welcome to new attendants, who actively took part in the discussion.

The next meeting will be on June 12, 2007.

Sixteens Meeting, June 12, 2007
------------------------------------

We had a new attendant. There was an interesting discussion about
different topics. Our impressions that Python is more and more widely
used for web programming. Even long-time PHP-user can not explain how they
could manage to work so long without Python. "Python fits your brain" describes
it nicely.

The next meeting will be on July 10, 2007.

Mike Mueller will give his talk `Parallelisierung von Pythonanwendungen mit Python Remote
Objects (PYRO)`_ (slides are in English).


Seventeens Meeting, July 10, 2007
------------------------------------

Mike Mueller gave his talk `Parallelisierung von Pythonanwendungen mit Python Remote
Objects (PYRO)`_ (slides are in English). The talk showed that distributed computation
doesn't need to be complicated. 

One of the topics of the disscusion was our workshop_ in September.

Eighteens Meeting, August 14, 2007
------------------------------------

We talked about the workshop_ on September 7.
Other topics included advantages and disadvantages of different
web frameworks, Python publications in different magazines, and
current Open Source projects of the participants.  


The next meeting will be on October 9, 2007.
The September meeting is replaced by the workshop_. 


Nineteens Meeting, October 9, 2007
------------------------------------

We wellcomed a new attendee.
Main topices were Nevow and Twisted.
Markus Zapke-Gruendemann presented a example application with Nevow.
This trigged a fruitful discussion about Nevow how to build a
application with it. Furthermore, we discussed the capabilties
of Twisted diskutiert.

The next meeting will be on November 13, 2007.
Julian Moritz will give a presentation titled "Django - Ein- und Ausblicke".


Twenties Meeting, November 13, 2007
------------------------------------

Julian Moritz gave an interesting presentation about Django.
The meeting was well attended. We had alively dicussion about features
of Django often compared to other webframeworks.


The next meeting will be on December 11, 2007.

Twentyfirst Meeting, December 11, 2007
----------------------------------------

Again we could welcome new people. The invitaions through XING_
work out nicely.
An interesting discussion devleoped. In addition to ubiquitous web applications we
also talked explicitly  about usage of Python in other fields. This included
scientific applications as wells as network performance tools.  

The next meeting will be on January 8, 2008.
