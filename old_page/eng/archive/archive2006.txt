Stefan Schwarzer gave a very interesting presentation_ about his Python module ftputil_.
This module provides a user-friendly interface to FTP client functionality.
The interface is modeled after the built-in modules ``os``, ``os.path`` and ``shutil``.
Therefore, remote files and directories on FTP-servers can be accessed very similarly to local files.

After the discussion we did some workshop preparation.  The fine tuning of the program
formatting was done as well as printing and folding of fliers.  The discussion about
how to best run the workshop yielded useful results.

The next meeting will be on October 10.  The regular date would be September12, but
this day is very close to the workshop, so that in a way the workshop replaces the meeting.
On October 10 Mike Müller will give his presentation "Python – the silent success of
a programming language".  This presentation will be given on October 16 at the technical
bookstore Lehmanns in Leipzig and serves as introduction to Python.
