Leipzig Python User Group - Archive 2012
========================================

Sixty Ninth Meeting, Tuesday January 10, 2012
-----------------------------------------------

Again we had a Python newbie attending who went home with a lot of new
information about Python. We will again exhibit at Chemnitzer Linux Tage.
We went through the questions we received last time and started to develop a
concept for our booth. 
 
The next meeting will be on February 14, 2012.

Seventieth Meeting, Tuesday February 14, 2012
---------------------------------------------

We started the project
`Python macht Schule <https://bitbucket.org/PySV/python_macht_schule>`_.
Last year |markus| in collaboration with the bookstore Lehmanns successfully
offered a Python course for kids. The last session was in December at Python
Academy.   

We would like to continue this project. As the first step we need appropriate
teaching material. Therefore we developed a 
`first outline <https://bitbucket.org/PySV/python_macht_schule/wiki/Home>`_.

Since the material is under an Open Source license (cc-by, 3cBSD), it will be
available for any purpose. The content is designed for kids and teenagers.
We would like to use the material for course here in Leipzig but also encourage
the use elsewhere. We would like to get teachers from different schools involved
as disseminators.

The next meeting will be on March 20, 2012.


Seventy First Meeting, Tuesday March 20, 2012
---------------------------------------------

We evaluated our booth at the Linux Fest Chemnitzer Linux-Tage.
This year there were three Python related booths. One tutorial and several talks
about Python topics were presented.

We continued the work on our project
`Python macht Schule <https://bitbucket.org/PySV/python_macht_schule>`_
and distributed the work for single chapters.

The next meeting will be on April 10, 2012.

Seventy Second Meeting, Tuesday April 10, 2012
----------------------------------------------

We discussed different topics such what possibilities Python offers to
communicate with Hardware. Another topic was GUI programming, especially
animation of text.

The next meeting will be on May 8, 2012.

Seventy Third Meeting, Tuesday May 8, 2012
---------------------------------------------

Mike Müller will talked about matplotlib_. This library allows to create 
2D Plots of high quality with only a few lines of Python.
The presentation demonstrated the basic principles with examples and
the possibilities to create animations and videos with matplotlib.

.. _matplotlib: http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/


The next meeting will be on June 12, 2012.

Seventy Fourth Meeting, Tuesday June 12, 2012
---------------------------------------------

We had a guest from the Munich Python User Group and the winner of
a Python coding contest. The discussion explored what happened in the
Python community at conferences. We also talk about ``else`` statement
at unusual places and why is good for. 

The next meeting will be on July 10, 2012.


Seventy Fifth Meeting, Tuesday July 10, 2012
--------------------------------------------

Andreas Bunkahle presented about Python und OpenCV.

OpenCV is a very powerful and fast library for image processing and machine
vision. The version 2.1 is stable works reliably with Python 2.6. Examples
of usage include face and pattern recognition as well as webcam control
or morphing among many other possibilities. 

The slides with source code are `available <http://www.bunkahle.com/links.cgi?num=0088>`_.
The source code is written and tested for version 2.1. Adjust the syntax for higher
OpenCV versions.

The next meeting will be on September 11, 2012. August is summer break.

Seventy Sixth Meeting, Tuesday September 11, 2012
-------------------------------------------------

Mike Müller reported about `EuroSciPy <http://www.euroscipy.org>`_.
The with edition of this conference took place in Brussels, Belgium. More
than 200 attendees enjoyed two days of tutorials and two days with
talks. Again, the conference covered a amazingly wide variety of scientific topics.

Mike presented his talk
`No GIL - Parallel Python Programming with Cython and OpenMP <http://www.euroscipy.org/talk/6857>`_. 
Cython allows to work with NumPy Arrays based on the commonly used OpenMP
technology for multicore, parallel programming. This allows to to temporally turn off the
Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).

The next meeting will be on November 13, 2012. The meeting in October will be
replaced by the PyCon DE 2012 conference.


Seventy Seventh Meeting, Tuesday November 13, 2012
--------------------------------------------------

We evaluated `PyCon DE 2012 <https://2012.de.pycon.org/>`_.
The conference was full success and, after two years in Leipzig, moves on
to `Cologne in 2013 <https://2013.de.pycon.org/>`_

A few of us took part in the Code Retreat of PyCon DE 2012.
We presented our impressions and did a bit of programming about
the "Game of Life".

The next meeting will be on December 11, 2012.

Seventy Eighth Meeting, Tuesday December 11, 2012
--------------------------------------------------

We had a barcamp-like session about concurrency and parallel programming.
Stefan Schwarzer presented parts of his `talk <https://2012.de.pycon.org/programm/schedule/sessions/29/>`_
at PyCon DE 2012.

The next meeting will be on January 8, 2013.
